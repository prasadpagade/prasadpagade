- FastAPI for high-performance orchestration APIs
- Real-time notification systems (Twilio) for human-in-the-loop workflows

### LLM Engineering & Fine-Tuning
Transforming general-purpose language models into specialized business tools through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation.

**Technical Highlights:**
- PEFT/LoRA for efficient model customization
- HuggingFace Transformers for model training and inference
- OpenAI/Anthropic Claude API integration
- RAG pipelines for grounded, contextual responses

### Enterprise Data Platforms
Scalable, cloud-native architectures that unify disparate data sources into cohesive intelligence layers.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Modern data stack (dbt, Airflow, Fivetran/Airbyte)
- Cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)
- Real-time streaming (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Containerized deployment (Docker, Kubernetes)

## 💡 TECHNICAL PHILOSOPHY

> **"The best technology is invisible."**  
> I build systems that solve problems so elegantly, users forget the complexity underneath.

> **"Ship early, iterate fast, measure obsessively."**  
> Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Launch MVPs, gather data, improve continuously.

> **"Teach, don't just build."**  
> Sustainable impact requires enabling teams to own solutions, not creating dependencies on individuals.

> **"Business outcomes over technical cleverness."**  
> The fanciest algorithm is worthless if it doesn't move the metrics that matter.
